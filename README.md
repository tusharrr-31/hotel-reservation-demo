## Prerequisites

* ballerina
* npm

## Steps

1) Clone Git Repo https://github.com/ballerina-guides/hotel-reservation-demo
2) Goto backend directory.
3) Refer to `backend/README.md` and generate the Record types for the service.
4) Add HTTP service component to implement API for the hotel reservation front end. 
   It should provide the following API paths. Please refer to README.md for more on service resources.

   1) Get available room types
   2) Create a reservation
   3) Update the reservation
   4) Get user reservations
   5) Delete the reservation

5) Improve tests and add a reservation with the following reservation.

```
{
   checkinDate: "2024-02-19T14:00:00Z", 
   checkoutDate: "2024-02-20T10:00:00Z", 
   rate: 100, 
   user: user, 
   roomType: "Family"
}

```


## TIPS: 
   
1)  Use two tables for Rooms and Reservations.
   
   ```
   table<Room> key(number) rooms;

   table<Reservation> key(id) roomReservations = table [];
   
   ```
   
2)  Use utils functions in utils.bal file.
